# Workshops

## WORKSHOP-01: Write a function to create a few users

```text
User
    userName:  user-1, user-2 and so on.  Must be unique.
    age: random between (10, 70)
    state: random state like [AK, AR, CA ... ]
```

You will call your function like this

```text
User [] users = createUsers(100);
```

And it will create 100 users with random values.

## WORKSHOP-02: Search users

- Print all users from a certain state : CA
- Print all users from gen-Z (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z#/media/File:Generation_timeline.svg)
